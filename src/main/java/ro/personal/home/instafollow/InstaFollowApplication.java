/*
THE APP SERVICES ARE WORKING JUST SOME DETAILS / tasks / improvements:
//TODO update the result analisis logic to take only confirmed
//TODO replace all prints with logs:
    - use spring logging https://www.baeldung.com/spring-boot-logging
    - Make 2 or 3 kinds of logs. only the most important should be put in console, the rest in a log file
//TODO ANALIZE PERIODICALLY
   - check how many of the request are not being processed, this is shown in the logs and maybe wait more and see
        if it improoves, or combine them, a follow then a removal and so on. Maybe at some point i can remove the confirmation
    - after a month or a week check in the DB- all should have confirmedRemoval = true and confirmedFoloowing = true,
        if not the logic is not good
    - after some time check what accounts did not followed back and adjust validation of follow request sending.
        THIS IS MANDATORY BECAUSE I HAVE some high values over there and they need to be tighte
//TODO go trough all files and:
        - check for all todos
        - check logic, how can it be imrpoved:
            - like you do at work before comiting to a reviewer
            - make a final review and add todos
            - the errors that you throw are not nice, make it another way
        - check warnings, and remove
        - remove all unused methods, and fields
        - breakdonww classes and methods into smaller - each method should have a single logic and to be clear
        - commit
//TODO - The App is build for raduvd: there are By locators that specifically search this username + the DB tables handle one account
//TODO - when processing list I must not move the mouse around, because there will be errors.
//TODO â—¦ When the app is really stable, Automate to maximum by following the steps:
            - Run the test with just one single tiny command
            - Use the app for like a week and debug When it fails
            - Make bash script with this single tiny mvn command (https://gist.github.com/shsteimer/a4a4b1c865830fdd5e41872cd2767106) )
