/*
THE APP SERVICES ARE WORKING JUST SOME DETAILS / tasks / improvements:
//TODO DO NOT WORK ON THIS ANY MORE, I HAVE SPENT A LOT!! MAXIMUM AN HOUR ONCE A WEEK + and small debug!!!
//TODO ANALIZE PERIODICALLY
   - check in DB how many removals are made in the REMOVE_NON_FOLLOWER process. If is zero or low, make the interval bigger, run more rarely
   - check how many of the request (follow or/and remove) are not being processed, this is shown in the logs and
        db and maybe wait more and see if it improoves, or combine them, a follow then a removal and so on.
        Maybe at some point i can remove the confirmation
    - after a month or a week check in the DB- all should have confirmedRemoval = true and confirmedFoloowing = true,
        if not the logic is not good
    - after some time check what accounts did not followed back and adjust validation of follow request sending.
        THIS IS MANDATORY BECAUSE I HAVE some high values over there and they need to be tighte
        there is a problem here because almost all users are invalid so I must add 100 each day,
        I do not have enough valid users so maybe loosen up a
        little bit and recheck the invalid users from db and additionally change the validatiopn logic
//TODO the like list logic will run and run and run.
   i really process hundreds of users per day, today i processed 600(hovered over 350) and got like 40 valid users
   so rally need a limit of hovers per day in order not to be blocked0
   i need to throw an error if it runs withouth iterating trough all the list simillary with the
   also put a counter in the like list logic, like send how big is the list as a param in the likelistlogic and decrement or something
//TODO am impresia ca daca dau follow la private account multe nu sunt procesate de instagram. dar cele non private requesturuile sunt trimise, check this
//  aici ar trebui sa adug niste logica ca sa o salvez in db in processResult si apoi sa o verific periodic
//TODO go trough all files and:
        - check for all todos
        - check logic, how can it be imrpoved:
            - like you do at work before comiting to a reviewer
            - make a final review and add todos
            - the errors that you throw are not nice, make it another way
        - check warnings, and remove
        - remove all unused methods, and fields
        - breakdonww classes and methods into smaller - each method should have a single logic and to be clear
        - commit
//TODO - The App is build for raduvd: there are By locators that specifically search this username + the DB tables handle one account
//TODO - when processing list I must not move the mouse around, because there will be errors.
//TODO â—¦ When the app is really stable, Automate to maximum by following the steps:
            - Make bash script with this single tiny mvn command (https://gist.github.com/shsteimer/a4a4b1c865830fdd5e41872cd2767106) )
